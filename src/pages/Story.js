          alone. Kept it a secret because this girl do not want people to
          mistaken her as attention seeker.

          She was in the dark and she tried baking her favorite dessert -
          brownies. Everything was self-learnt and she started to find baking is
          therapeutic and helped calming her thoughts and noises in her head.

          As days passed by, she has baked uncountable trays of brownies by
          selling online and offline. She perfected the brownies to the right
          sweetness and fudginess.

          Little did she know that baking theraphy has helped her earned some
          pocket money throughout her college days and gained confidence
          throughout the journey as people giving her feedbacks and comment
          about how amazing the brownies is and how the brownies was involved in
